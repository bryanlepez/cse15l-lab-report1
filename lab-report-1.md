# Lab Report 1
For this lab you will be learning how to setup your CSE15L account for the first time. If needed, you will also be installing Visual Studio Code. These two things will be necessary to practice connecting to a remote server for the very first time!(in this class atleast)



## Setting Up Account for Lab
The first thing to do is to find your specific course account. You can do that here:

[Find Account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

1. Log in with your UCSD credentials.
2. Choose your account(make sure to choose the cs15l account as there is a possibility that you have multiple accounts).
3. Follow the on screen instructions to reset your password.

**Personal Experience**
* For me logging in to the website provided was very smooth because I just used my UCSD credentials(as prompted) to log in.
* However when it came to changing my password I had to reset it twice because I forgot it when I was connnecting to the remote server(I'll talk about this later on)

## Installing Visual Studio Code
You will now need something to be able to access a terminal and connect to a remote server. Thus, we will be installing Visual Studio Code. If you don't want to install VScode for whatever reason(I suggest you do) then you can just access it on the CS lab computers.
You can Install Visual Studio code here:

[Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Make sure that you install the correct version depending on your device

After you click download that is specific for your device, you want to follow the on screen instructions. When it is installed you should be able to open a program that looks like the following:

Congratulations! You now have Visual Studio Code installed on your device and don't have to rely on the lab computers.

**Personal Experience**
* I personally did not have to do this step as I already had VScode installed due to prior CS courses that I took(might be the case for a lot of people).
* One important thing to remember is to make sure to download the version of Visual Studio Code that is meant for your specific device.
